## Basic Programs
1. **Write a program to check whether a number is Ramanujan number or not** <br>
   **Example1:** <br>
    1729<br>
    1+7++2+9=19<br>
    Reverse =91<br>
    19*91=1729<br>

2. **Write a program to check whether a number is Tech number or not** <br>
   **Example1:** <br>
     2025<br>
     20+25=45<br>
     45^2=2025<br>

3. **Write a Program to accept two integers as command line arguments and print the sum of the two numbers.**  
   **Example1:** <br>
C:>java Sample 10 2<br>
O/P Expected: The sum of 10 and 20 is 30<br>

4. **Write a program to check if a given integer number is Positive, Negative, or zero.**

     ---

6. **Given two non-negative int values, print true if they have the same last digit, such as with 27 and 57.**  
**Examples:** <br>
lastDigit (7, 17) ‚Üí true<br>
lastDigit (6, 17) ‚Üí false<br>
lastDigit (3, 113) ‚Üí true<br>
7. **Write a program to check if a given integer number is odd or even.**

   ---

8. **Write a program to check if the program has received command line arguments or not.**  
If the program has not received arguments, then print "No Values", else print all the values in a single line separated by a comma (`,`).  
**Example1:** <br>
java Example<br>
O/P: No values<br>
**Example2:**<br>
java Example Mumbai Bangalore <br>
O/P: Mumbai, Bangalore <br>
**Hint:** You can use the length property of an array to check its length.

9. **Write a program to accept gender ("Male" or "Female") and age from command line arguments and print the percentage of interest based on the given conditions.**  
**Conditions:**  
- If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.2%.  
- If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 9.2%.  
- If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.4%.  
- If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 10.5%.

14. **Write a program to print the sum of all the digits of a given number.**  
 **Example1:** <br>
 I/P: 1234<br>
 O/P: 10 <br>

 ---
15. **Write a program to print * in the following format (using for and while loop):**  
 ```
 *  
 * *  
 * * *  
 * * * *  
 ```  
 **Example1:**  
 ```
 C:\>java Sample  
 O/P: Please enter an integer number  
 ```  
 **Example2:**  
 ```
 C:\>java Sample 3  
 O/P:  
 *  
 * *  
 * * *  
 ```

###  Palindrome Check

15.Write a Java program to find if the given number is a palindrome or not.

**Example 1:**<br>
C:>java Sample 110011 O/P: 110011 is a palindrome<br>
**Example 2:**<br>
C:>java Sample 1234 O/P: 1234 is not a palindrome<br>

###  Array Sum and Average

16.Write a program to initialize an integer array and print the sum and average of the array.

---

### 17. Array Maximum and Minimum

Write a program to initialize an integer array and find the maximum and minimum value of the array.

---

### 18. Array Sorting

Write a program to initialize an array and print them in a sorted order.

## OOPS / Inheritance

### 19. Box Class with Volume Calculation

Create a class `Box` that uses a parameterized constructor to initialize the dimensions of a box. The dimensions of the box are width, height, and depth. The class should have a method that can return the volume of the box.

- **Objective:** Create an object of the `Box` class and test the functionality.

---

### 20. Calculator Class with Power Methods

Create a new class called `Calculator` with the following methods:

1. **Static Method:** `powerInt(int num1, int num2)`
   - This method should return `num1` raised to the power `num2`.

2. **Static Method:** `powerDouble(double num1, double num2)`
   - This method should return `num1` raised to the power `num2`.

3. **Invoke both methods and test the functionalities.**

- **Hint:** Use `Math.pow(double, double)` to calculate the power.
