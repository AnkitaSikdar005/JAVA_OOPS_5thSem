# Java Programming Exercises

## Basic Programs
1. **Write a program to check whether a number is Ramanujan number or not** <br>
   **Example1:** <br>
    1729<br>
    1+7++2+9=19<br>
    Reverse =91<br>
    19*91=1729<br>
2. **Write a program to check whether a number is Tech number or not** <br>
   **Example1:** <br>
     2025<br>
     20+25=45<br>
     45^2=2025<br>
3. **Write a Program to accept two integers as command line arguments and print the sum of the two numbers.**  
   **Example1:** <br>
C:>java Sample 10 2<br>
O/P Expected: The sum of 10 and 20 is 30<br>
4. **Write a program to check if a given integer number is Positive, Negative, or zero.**

5. **Given two non-negative int values, print true if they have the same last digit, such as with 27 and 57.**  
**Examples:** <br>
lastDigit (7, 17) â†’ true<br>
lastDigit (6, 17) â†’ false<br>
lastDigit (3, 113) â†’ true<br>
6. **Write a program to check if a given integer number is odd or even.**

7. **Write a program to check if the program has received command line arguments or not.**  
If the program has not received arguments, then print "No Values", else print all the values in a single line separated by a comma (`,`).  
**Example1:** <br>
java Example<br>
O/P: No values<br>
**Example2:**<br>
java Example Mumbai Bangalore <br>
O/P: Mumbai, Bangalore <br>
**Hint:** You can use the length property of an array to check its length.

8. **Write a program to accept gender ("Male" or "Female") and age from command line arguments and print the percentage of interest based on the given conditions.**  
**Conditions:**  
- If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.2%.  
- If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 9.2%.  
- If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.4%.  
- If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 10.5%.

9. **Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 in a single row with one tab space.**

## Intermediate Programs

10. **Write a program to print even numbers between 23 and 57. Each number should be printed in a separate row.**

11. **Write a program to check if a given number is prime or not.**

12. **Write a program to print prime numbers between 10 and 99.**

13. **Write a program to print the sum of all the digits of a given number.**  
 **Example1:** <br>
 I/P: 1234<br>
 O/P: 10 <br>
14. **Write a program to print * in the following format (using for and while loop):**  
 ```
 *  
 * *  
 * * *  
 * * * *  
 ```  
 **Example1:**  
 ```
 C:\>java Sample  
 O/P: Please enter an integer number  
 ```  
 **Example2:**  
 ```
 C:\>java Sample 3  
 O/P:  
 *  
 * *  
 * * *  
 ```
